# Obesity Risk Prediction

## Problem statement

This project is based on the Kaggle competition [Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk](https://kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e2).

The objective is to predict obesity risk in individuals.

## About the dataset

The dataset was generated from a deep learning model trained on the [Obesity or CVD risk](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindpcoder/obesity-or-cvd-risk-classifyregressorcluster) dataset. The data consist of the estimation of obesity levels among individuals from Mexico, Peru and Columbia aged 14 to 61 with diverse eating habits and physical conditions. 

The dataset includes several predictor variables such as the age, the weight, the physical activity frequency, the family history with overweight, etc., and one target variable, the obesity level, which can take 7 values :
    - Insufficient_Weight
    - Normal_Weight
    - Overweight_Level_I
    - Overweight_Level_II
    - Obesity_Type_I
    - Obesity_Type_II
    - Obesity_Type_III

## Technologies used

Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors 

## Result

The Random Forest Classifier performed best with an accuracy of 90%.
